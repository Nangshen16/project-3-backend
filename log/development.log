Evoking the isolation of a night drive, the EP further explores the dystopian themes touched upon in Payne\xE2\x80\x99s earlier work. Reverse Fall is the producer\xE2\x80\x99s debut record with Berlin institution Ostgut Ton, having already released on their sub-label Unterton last year. Despite holding residencies at respected clubs such as Berghain and Tbilisi\xE2\x80\x99s Khidi, Payne\xE2\x80\x99s musical upbringing was far removed from the club environment. Instead, he was raised on the sounds of post punk and cold wave introduced by his father. In fact, it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t until his teenage years when he started attending the infamous Wierd parties formerly held at New York\xE2\x80\x99s Home Sweet Home, that he was exposed to the heavier sounds being imported over from Europe. As a result, Payne has crafted a signature sound that fuses the sounds of early \xE2\x80\x9980s EBM with modern techno. For him, these two genres are intrinsically linked, with techno developing from the work of earlier pioneers such as Kraftwerk and DAF.
