M/S/T,M/S/T,05/01/2018,Moon Villain,"M/S/T is the NYC based avant-garde jazz trio of drummer Mason Macias, saxophonist/flautist Craig Schenker, and drummer John Thayer. They formed in 2017 (after previously performing with Marnie Stern, Matana Roberts, and Drunken Sufis) and recorded their debut album, a collage of improvisations colored with vintage tape echoes and reverbs, at Thump Studios in Brooklyn.

The two sides of the resulting cassette show the sound of a group that has found it’s collective voice. Spontaneous, playful, and aware; this is reactionary music that evolves as a dialog between players through conversational percussion and echoes of European folk melodies.",https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2704868402_16.jpg,https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0014957695_10.jpg
Lea Thomas  & John Thayer,Blue of Distance,10/4/2019,Spirit House Records,"“Blue of Distance”, was written and recorded over the course of an artist’s residency in a solar paneled cabin deep in the sage bush mountains of northeast Nevada. Lea discusses the “cosmic wink” of getting to wake up every day in a vast wilderness, and the creative energy it brought about. After getting stuck in a desert storm, Lea began to see the wild as a place that brings around our own smallness, and therefore earns our respect. “It was really interesting being able to observe and create within the same breath,” she explains of the studio experience, “I think that was something that was really unique to being in that place and time.” 

By sampling natural sounds and creating from this place of introspection and outrospection, Lea and her partner John Thayer produced a rich tapestry of lyrics of sounds reflecting the landscape, a manifestation of the art of observation.",https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2180070741_16.jpg,https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/89/c0/db89c0bf49626101557bc40a8ee16059.jpg
The Internet,Hive Mind,07/24/2018,Odd Future,"Their fourth album, Hive Mind, is an act of collective conviction. It simplifies and shores up the Internet sound with soft-focus blues, plush arrangements, and deep-in-the-ground grooves. The beats are shapelier, more boldly defined, and yet they still have the capacity to bleed into each other. “They gon’ get us to come together,” a chorus of voices sings on the album’s opening song, each utterance louder than the one before. And just as the title implies, they are more in sync here than ever.",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5b4657150e04ca4ea852ee9e/1:1/w_320/theinternet_hivemind.jpg,https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-internet-2018-north-american-tour-dates.png
Phony Ppl,Yesterday's Tomorrow,01/13/2015,Phony Ppl LLC,"I would have missed this album myself except for a chance December encounter in the Columbus Circle subway station. This Brooklyn future-R&B quintet, an evolution in personnel, direction and hard-ball touring since 2011 was performing for commuters and promoting an after-midnight residency at the Blue Note. I stopped because the first number I heard was hard, sharply cut funk vintage Living Colour with garage-rock force and stayed because the soul got bolder and deeper in ""Why iii Love the Moon,"" an instant knockout of velvet-Seventies romance and Kaya-era Bob Marley. Phony Ppl have a long library of internet drops, but this 15-track album, released in January and including that killer ""Moon,"" is the band's true declaration of arrival a matured fusion of modern-pop songcraft, live-band hip-hop drive, classic-R&B singing and instrumental Steely Dan poise. Guitarist Elijah Rawk, bassist Bari Bass, drummer Matt Byas, keyboard player Aja Grant and singer Elbee Thrie have history and ties with Theophilus London, the Roots and Erykah Badu. They are now ready for their close-up.",https://images.genius.com/150c978f0ec672ec2fd05dfa903f33da.768x768x1.jpg,https://c8d8q6i8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Phony-Ppl-Contact-Information.jpg
Kendrick Lamar,"good kid, m.A.A.d city",10/23/2012,Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE),"Overall, good kid, m.A.A.d city is an invigorating LP. Every record is both complexly arranged and sonically fitting, foregrounding Kendricks vivid lyricism and amazing control of cadence. Theres not a single loophole. From the prayers on “Sherane a.k.a. Master Splinters Daughter” to the triumphant ending on “Compton,” each skit and track interweaves one another, solidifying a complete picture. While only time can determine the albums fate, this life chronicle of Kendrick has all if not more of the qualities rapes now living and deceased legends have carved in stone. Its an undeniably stellar major label debut from Kendrick Lamar, which will certainly hurt the self-esteem of many rappers out now while also inspiring them to reach these heights.

Chris and Cosey,Carter Tutti Plays Chris and Cosey,"February 26th, 2015",Conspiracy International,"Chris & Cosey's best songs create a thrilling energy from the start, and something about this idea gets to the root of what a lot of us want music to do in the first place. In its new clothes, the sense of build they possess – the knowing exactly when to engage and when to withdraw, when to zoom into techno territory and fade back into synth - is a central sensibility they retain here. Throughout their recording career, they've struck a careful symmetry between spontaneous, carnal creation and exacting a formulaic structure with specific intentions for each record. So why is 'Lost Bliss' the official starting point? I like to think it's because this is from the record – Megatropolis – a collection of work from 1988-2001 where they both struck on the thing that they can do better than anyone else – capturing precise sensations of simple pleasure; that satisfying ba-doomph of a machine smack, the delicious dankness of a well-tempered bass synth, tense reverbs amping up the music's visceral tremble. The track is an invocation of electronic music, and Tutti's voice sweeps in with haunting gusto to deliver a set of sliding phrases over sparkly synthesisers. They just hang there exerting an intense emotional force field - a feeling repeated on 'Obsession.' Its sound nostalgic soaked with a retro-futuristic minimalism that could summon a nightclub from a parallel future. It's gorgeous. The sex is there: ""Touch me, make me cry, desire me"", but there are clearly better things to do about sex than just obsess about it – possess it, for one – relish in it, for another.",https://img.discogs.com/5eAuM5DS4nprz-TpDDN1_L7Cako=/fit-in/600x539/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/R-6733464-1425550273-8880.jpeg.jpg,https://img.discogs.com/pi-Z7j8L8z_wPgHP0mKs2JLjayI=/499x522/smart/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/A-29040-1450905762-4295.jpeg.jpg
Andy Stott,It Should Be Us,2019,Modern Love,"It has been three years since Stott’s last LP, Too Many Voices, and eight since he put out a pair of consecutive double-packs that radically redefined the sound that, until then, he had shared with many of his Modern Love labelmates—a nuanced, warehouse-ready strain of techno that balanced Detroit’s expressive release with Berlin’s dub atmospheres. Passed Me By and We Stayed Together pulled the rug out from beneath dance-music convention, slowing the tempo to a rickety crawl and wrapping his synths in a layer of grit. It was less deconstruction than exhumation, with zombie beats trudging dully forward, dead-eyed and caked in earth.

It was less deconstruction than exhumation, with zombie beats trudging dully forward, dead-eyed and caked in earth.

Stott reached his peak with Luxury Problems and Faith in Strangers, infusing slow-motion techno with hints of goth and bass music; at its best—particularly on songs featuring the vocalist Alison Skidmore—the results suggested the lo-fi trap remix of This Mortal Coil you never knew you needed. On the slightly scattered Too Many Voices, it sometimes felt like Stott couldn’t decide where to go from there—to choose light or shadow, movement or stasis—but with It Should Be Us, he plunges straight into the wreckage and never looks back.",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc5e210a9726900084045de/1:1/w_320/stott.jpg,https://s3.amazonaws.com/factmag-images/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/09101607/Andy-Stott-interview-2.jpg
Phase Fatale,Reverse Fall,"July 18, 2018",Ost Gut Ton,"J.G. Ballard’s Crash is a jarring insight into car-crash sexual fetishism. The controversial novel is a central inspiration for Hayden Payne, aka Phase Fatale’s most recent record. Evoking the isolation of a night drive, the EP further explores the dystopian themes touched upon in Payne’s earlier work. Reverse Fall is the producer’s debut record with Berlin institution Ostgut Ton, having already released on their sub-label Unterton last year. Despite holding residencies at respected clubs such as Berghain and Tbilisi’s Khidi, Payne’s musical upbringing was far removed from the club environment. Instead, he was raised on the sounds of post punk and cold wave introduced by his father. In fact, it wasn’t until his teenage years when he started attending the infamous Wierd parties formerly held at New York’s Home Sweet Home, that he was exposed to the heavier sounds being imported over from Europe. As a result, Payne has crafted a signature sound that fuses the sounds of early ’80s EBM with modern techno. For him, these two genres are intrinsically linked, with techno developing from the work of earlier pioneers such as Kraftwerk and DAF. Formally, similarities are to be found in the mechanical instrumentation, and dark atmospheres, and by combining these genres, Payne refreshes the 4×4 rhythms of conventional techno.",https://hyponik.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Artwork_O-TON-113_Phase-Fatale_1800x1800px.jpg,https://s3.amazonaws.com/quietus_production/images/articles/23234/Phase_Fatale_Press_Pic_1___Fredrik_Altinell_1505916872.jpg
